 Information about PMODE/W 1.33i
---------------------------------

        Over the past year or so I have received alot of requests for a
squashed down version of PMODE/W to be used specifically for small intros
and demos. Well today I took a few minutes and ripped out as much stuff as
I could that I figure won't be used in an intro. Due to the architecture of
the extender many functions are codependant so there are functions which
still remain only because they simply cannot be removed.

        As many of you may or may not know, PMODE/W is no longer being
developed or supported (except for licensed users). This release represents
nothing and it comes with no guarantees whatsoever. If it works for you,
great. If it doesn't, then I don't really need to hear about it.

The following files should be found in this archive:

        PMODEWI.EXE     PMODE/W 1.33i WITHOUT EXE Compression
        PMODEWIC.EXE    PMODE/W 1.33i WITH EXE Compression
        PMODEWI.TXT     Duh

This stuff was removed for PMODE/W v1.33i:

        INT 31h Function 800h-801h Physical Address Mapping
        Exception Handling
        INT 33h Mouse Handler
        INT 1Bh Control-Break Handler
        INT 21h Functions 56h, 4Fh, 4Eh, 4Bh, 47h, 43h, 1Fh, 1Bh, 1Ch
        All Error Message Text
        EXE Compression (though I left this in for PMODEWIC.EXE)

Linking and compiling should be second nature by now , and I need
not say that it would probably be bad to make a call to any of the functions
that were removed unless you do it yourself via INT 31h function 300h.

If you MUST contact me you can send email to daredevi@dorsai.org though I have
no clue how long that address will remain active. I can also be found most
often on SceneNet #trax (irc.scene.org).
